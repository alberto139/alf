# alf: Another (Deep) Learning Framework
Another (Deep) Learning Framework

Alf is an attempt to implement a somewhat functional deep learning framework as a learning exercise for myself. The idea is to reimplement some of the seminal works in the field of deep learning using only (mostly) this framework. 

The first deep learning architecture implemented with alf will be [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).
